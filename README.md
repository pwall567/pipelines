# pipelines

Pipeline conversion library for Java

A collection of pipeline classes that take an input (frequently an `int` value) and produce a another value.
The conversion may be one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-one.
A frequent use is for character encoding (conversion of bytes to characters and _vice versa_) and several classes are
provided to perform such conversions.
