/**
 * <h1>Pipeline conversion library for Java</h1>
 *
 * <p>A collection of pipeline classes that take an input (frequently an {@code int} value) and produce a another
 * value.  The conversion may be one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-one.  A frequent use is for character encoding
 * (conversion of bytes to characters and <i>vice versa</i>) and several classes are provided to perform such
 * conversions.</p>
